# Neo4j Time-series Initialization

The standard method of modelling time-series in graphs is a tree structure. Here we get a ballancing act regarding granularity. In this script I opt to limit granularity to the day, as put forth by others<sup>*</sup>, as per the needs of the side-project this supplimented.

For ease, this runs in your browser. Just enter the creds and your server address and click Go. For further ease, you can run this from my [site](http://kylechinnock.com/), [here](http://kylechinnock.com/neo4j-timeseries-init). Check the code, I don't bite.
